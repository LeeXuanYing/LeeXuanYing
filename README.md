 **Assignment 1**
- For this assignment , we visited the NALI ( New Academia Learning Innovation ) event organized by Universiti Teknologi Malaysia. The event is participated by many students aiming to present their project and achieve their goal by using the means of combining various aspects of technology and information systems. My view on how technology such as Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, Motion Input and more can be integrated and used is expanded, knowing there are much more creative approaches one can take to develop their project. Interviewing the participants also allows me to understand the mindset and tools required to tackle the project they aim to create.I would like to participate in more events like NALI in the future to see more creative takes on using technology and information systems.

**Assignment 2**
- For this industry talk from Clarity Techwork, a fintech company in both Singapore and Malaysia that specialize in Fintech Solution, Blockchain Technology, Cybersecurity and Cloud Solution. The industry talk let me learn the skills required in order to perform well within the industry, what technologies that we should learn and utilize vscode, Jira, Slack and more. Personnels from different positions and fields within the company structure and go into details about the job scope covered by these positions and fields. The personnels also share their work experiences comparing the difference in internship period and employee period. This allows me to have more experience and confidence in the technology fields as I am able to work off of experiences and knowledge of alumni.

**Assignment 3**
- For this Industry visit to UTMDigital, we get to know the work environments of the employees who work for UTMDigital and the functionality of different rooms and what are the selective rooms the respective division works at. It let me know that an activity like discussion can be made easier or more in depth given the right workspace environment or appropriate technology such as the implementation of wipeable wall, projector output, drawable digital whiteboard and more. It allows the research and development department to have a smoother developing process. I also got to learn the structure and managing a server room, making sure it is secured and well ventilated to prevent overheating. This industry visit to UTMDigital allowed me to have a first hand view of how a workplace environment is in the technology and information system fields.

**Assignment 4**
- This industry talk is presented by UTM graduate of Bachelor Computer Science, Qistina Batrisya Binti Azman Shah , who specialize in Analytic Delivery and AI Operation. In this industry talk, I learned about data analytics, utilizing various data either from database , external data and social media to be analyzed through means of data collection, data transforming, analytics and modeling, prediction and visualization to obtain insights and make strategic, tactical, and operational decisions. I also learned applications to handle databases through OLAP ( Online Analytical Processing ), visualization tools, ELT ( Extract Load Transform ) and programming languages used. Learning how to sort out databases and visualizing them will lead to easier to digest information and organization of information for self-use or to present to others.

**PC Assembly**
- From this activity , I get to know how to assemble a PC using different components. I learned about the various components in the PC including their functionality and how they connect to each other using bus cable. We got to learn how to properly handle the Power Unit , RAM , Hard Disk Drive ,CPU ,Fan and were taught to assemble and take off the computer casing which houses the computer components within it. It will help greatly when one day I decide to purchase and build my own PC, as building one's own PC allows one to be flexible with parts purchases and tend to make cost flexible and cheaper than market price PC.
